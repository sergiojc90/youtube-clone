# The Odin Project - HTML and CSS - Basic HTML Page Structure
## Project: Embedding Images and Video

Hi!, this is my repository in which i share my solution to The Odin Project HTML and CSS module of the Fullstack JavaScript Curricullum.

I followed the instructions of the "Project: Embedding Images and Video". For me, the main challange was to make the webpage responsive. In order to achive this, i used CSS Grid and media queries.
